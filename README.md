# MNIST

This project is the 'Hello World' for machine learning. This project was to showcase a simple number recognition using neural network.

## Skills

With this project, I attended to learn some tools/skills for professional use:

* Machine Learning
* Neural Network

## Experience

Beginning with this project, I started with the basic knowledge of neural network and backpropagation. The input is a simple 2d arrays of pixel that runs through the neural network to output a digit value. The algorithim uses backpropagation to 'learn' from the training set. The data set use comes from MNIST library.
